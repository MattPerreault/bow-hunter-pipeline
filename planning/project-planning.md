4.  Set up weather data API client.
5.  Design initial ETL pipeline structure.

## Phase 2: Core Data Model and DuckDB Schema

### Actionable Tasks:
1.  Define detailed DuckDB schema for elk statistics, GIS data, and weather.
2.  Implement DuckDB database initialization and connection.
3.  Develop data loading scripts to populate DuckDB from processed data.
4.  Create initial indexing strategies for efficient queries.

## Phase 3: Analysis Engine and Success Rate Calculations

### Actionable Tasks:
1.  Implement algorithms for calculating elk hunting success rates.
2.  Integrate historical data for predictive modeling.
3.  Develop modules for spatial analysis of GMU/DAU data.
4.  Create basic reporting functions for analysis results.

## Phase 4: API and MCP Server Implementation

### Actionable Tasks:
1.  Design and implement FastAPI endpoints for programmatic access.
2.  Integrate the analysis engine with the REST API.
3.  Develop the MindsDB integration for the NL Interface via the MCP server.
4.  Create comprehensive API documentation and examples.

## Phase 5: Weather Integration and Enhanced Predictions

### Actionable Tasks:
